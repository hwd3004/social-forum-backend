My goal is making social forum web site like reddit.

This directory will be backend of social forum proejct.

There are some things to check before coding.

1. .gitignore

i added file node .gitignore by vscode extension gitignore.

2. node and npm version

Node installed in my laptop is 18.12.0 version.

current stable is 18.12.1 version.

```shell
npm ls -g --depth=0
```

The global modules I am using are nodemon, ts-node and typescript.

I deleted 18.12.0 version and installed 18.12.1 version and The global modules.

That Was it. checking was good.

I will using typescript, express, postgresql, graphql.

I can add anything good while working on the project.

Initialize.

```shell
npm init -y

tsc --init

npm i tsc-watch -D
```

I used the typescript setting that i wrote on my blog(https://liufeier.tistory.com/330) before.
